# Preparing files for enrichment analysis (by Torus)

## Background
As the results generated by binary eQTL data are not satisfying enough, I used eQTL PIP data instead, attempting to obtain better results.

## Methods
The eQTL PIPs are converted to binary eQTL states by a pre-specified PIP threshold. Then the binary eQTL states are used as before.

## Input
GWAS data, eQTL PIP data

## Output
$\alpha_1$, credible intervals of $\alpha_1$

## File locations preparation

### enrichment_file_preparation.sh

Usage: `./enrichment_file_preparation.sh`

This script is still under developing. Please refer to the script for details.
