This project is about enrichment analysis of 44 tissues of eQTL in GTEx, which is performed in 2 ways. One is performed in binary annotations, and the other is in PIPs, i.e., continuous annotations.

Please see the results as follows.

* [SCZ against binary annotations of GTEx eQTLs](binary.html)

* [SCZ against PIPs of GTEx eQTLs](PIP.html)
