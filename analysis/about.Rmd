Describe your project.

This project is about enrichment analysis of 44 tissues of eQTL in GTEx, which is performed in 2 ways. One is performed in binary annotations, and the other is in PIPs, i.e., continuous annotations. So far, I have only finished the binary annotations part, whose results are shown below.
