I have used PIPs of GTEx eQTLs as annotations, and the results are terrible. Please see Figure 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(png)
PIP_img <- readPNG(source = '/Users/cjr/Documents/留学/暑研/Xin/reading_materials/5th/PIP_messy.png')
library(grid)
grid.raster(PIP_img)
```

Figure 1: enrichment of PIPs.

And the data are shown in Table 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
PIP_table <- read.csv(file = '/Users/cjr/Documents/留学/暑研/Xin/reading_materials/5th/PIP_messy.csv', sep = '\t', header = TRUE)
library(knitr)
kable(PIP_table, caption = 'SCZ against PIP')
```

Generally speaking, the standard deviation is approximately 100 times as much as log odds ratio in each tissue, regardless of whether in brain or not.

As for the reason why the results are so awful, it is probably that continuous annotations are usually unstable.
